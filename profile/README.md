## Major Projects

### CUNE Cupid

CUNE Cupid is a matchmaking algorithm, paired with a survey. We brought on the project from a few business majors, which has an original survey and a few excel sheets. From there we have created a Data Science Pipeline to transform and create matching via a Bipartite Graph. 

This project was led by Vice President [Neal Patron](https://github.com/nealpatron) and developed using Jupyter Notebooks.
